# House-Modeling-CG

The **House Modeling** is a 3D graphics application that demonstrates the rendering and animation of 3D models using OpenGL and the Assimp library. This project showcases the process of loading 3D models, materials, textures, animations, and simulating real-time rendering using modern graphics techniques.

## Description

The main goal of this project is to provide a hands-on example of working with 3D graphics in a real-time rendering environment. The application loads 3D models in various formats, processes their materials, and displays them on the screen. It also supports animations, allowing users to interactively control the camera and explore the 3D scenes.

## Key Features

- **3D Model Rendering:** View 3D models with realistic lighting, materials, and textures, enhancing their visual quality.

- **Animation Playback:** Import animations along with models and play them in real-time, showcasing dynamic movements and transformations.

- **Camera Control:** Navigate the 3D scene using a user-friendly camera system, allowing zoom, rotation, and movement.

- **Bone Animation:** Support for skeletal animations with bone transformations, enabling complex character animations.

- **Model Interaction:** Interact with the loaded 3D models, examining them from different angles and perspectives.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive user interface provides controls for loading models, applying animations, and adjusting camera settings.
